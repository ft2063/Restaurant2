This is my second css project!

I coded from scratch the page (responsive, one page) Simple project but adaptable to different devices. Bootstrap is used to help with the container-fluid class This class easily adapts the width/height of image to different screens (automatically) which is even better than thinking of col-lg-4 and so on grid format As per requested, drop down menu activates for small devices only

This project is required for the completion of the course _HTML by , CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers _taught by Yaakov Chaikin, on Coursera (Johns Hopkins University)
